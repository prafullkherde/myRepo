## Can do or can improve with more time
* This can be fitted like a one directive. So any one can use anywhere like component
* I can use more secure way as https://darksky.net/dev/docs/forecast
* Some time it required time to get response so you see? On screen.
* Can add proper logging system 
* Make use (and parse) more provided weather data (+ add filters, formatting)
* Internationalization / Localization
* Make it available off line 
* Provide "use current location" and fetch data via lat/lon
* Build a view with n-day-forecast in typical weather app style
* Improve UI/UX by integrating a fancy design, transitions and effects
